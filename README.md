# polibox
This is polibox, my project for the Internet Applications exam (computer engineering master at Politecnico di Torino).

The project is a real time sharing system, multi-user, multi-device, operative system independent. 
The tool parts are: 
- a java desktop application, that synchronize bidirectionally a directory from your file system to the server and receives realtime notifications; 
- a server web application that manage both synchronization and web contents;
- a single page application for the browser.
